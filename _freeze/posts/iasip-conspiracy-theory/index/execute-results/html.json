Validated means that it's been through a series of studies with a view of establishing if we are measuring what we intend to measure. Today, we'll be using the [Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00279/full).\n\n## Background\n\nThe Conspiracy Theory questionnaire has 15 statements. A set of three statements measures a single factor (consider a factor to be a facet of personality such as Extraversion, Openness, etc.) So, in total, the questionnaire measures five factors, which are as follows:\\\n\n1.  Government Malfeasance -- beliefs around the Government being involved in underhanded activities.\n\n2.  Extraterrestrial Cover-Up -- beliefs that evidence of aliens is being withheld from public knowledged\n\n3.  Malevolent Global Conspiracies -- beliefs that a small group of individuals make all global decisions.\n\n4.  Personal Wellbeing -- beliefs that technological developments/advances are all motivated by mind-control.\n\n5.  Control of Information -- beliefs that evidence is being suppressed to deceive the public.\n\nThis is all a bit serious so let's lighten it up slightly...\n\nIn the previous post, I showed how a character persona could be used to manipulate responses to a Buzzfeed quiz. We're going to do that again (because I'm unoriginal)! This time we're switching from Fraiser to It's Always Sunny in Philidelphia... I know, mind blown.\n\n![The gang completing the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale, whilst also being aptly dressed. Image generated using Co-Pilot and the following prompt '*IASIP, the gang complete questionnaires dressed like conspiracy theorists \\-- make into pixel art*'.](images/the-gang.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## How\n\n### Page Navigation\n\nWe use Playwright to navigate the webpage. This includes starting the questionnaire, findings the questionnaire statements, the response scale (Agree to Disagree), and selecting our response. In addition, we take advantage of Playwright's ability to take screenshots and videos so we can record the interactions.\n\nThe video below shows this automation in action. It is important to note that the questionnaire ends with the following question: *Did you try your best and can we store your data and use for research?* For each run, we answered with *No*. We do not want these responses being recorded and used.\n\n![Completing the conspiracy theorist questionnaire using the Dennis Reynolds persona.](videos/dennis_reynolds_questionnaire.mp4){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Personas\n\nTo generate our persons for each of the It's Always Sunny characters, we use the descriptions found [here](https://screenrant.com/always-sunny-philadelphia-cast-characters-guide/). Each description was passed to Chat-GPT, with the prompt '*Give me a profile based on...*\\[character description\\]'.\n\n### Generative AI\n\nThe OpenAI Python package was again used to interact with Chat-GPT 4.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.python .cell-code}\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom classes.character_person import CharacterPersona\nfrom functions.chat_gpt_quiz_response import answer_quiz_question\n\nload_dotenv()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    response_to_value = {\n        \"Disagree\": 0,\n        \"Somewhat Disagree\": 1,\n        \"Neutral\": 2,\n        \"Somewhat Agree\": 3,\n        \"Agree\": 4\n    }\n\n    client = OpenAI(\n        api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPEN_AI_KEY\"),\n    )\n\n    frank_reynolds = CharacterPersona(\n        character_name=\"Frank Reynolds\",\n        character_persona=\"\"\"\n        As Frank Reynolds, patriarch of a dysfunctional family tangled\\\\\n        in a web of deception and debauchery, I embrace a life of chaos\\\\\n        and filth with unbridled enthusiasm.

They negatively responded (Somewhat Disagreed or Disagreed) to 46.7% of statements.\n\nOn completion of the questionnaire, we get a results page (see image below). The results give the user a breakdown across each facet of being a conspiracy theorist. So you can see that Frank scored highest on Government Malfeasance, but scored lower on Personal Well-Being. Finally, we can see how the score compared to a normative group, in this case college students. We see that Frank's score was higher than this average.\n\n![Frank's final results on the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale provided at the end of the questionnaire.](images/frank_reynolds_results.png){#franks-results fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Charlie\n\nCharlie positively responded (Somewhat Agreed or Agreed) to 33.3% of the statements. They negatively responded (Somewhat Disagreed or Disagreed) to 40% of statements.\n\nCharlie seems to score high on overall conspiracist beliefs. As with Frank, Charlie scores low on Personal Well-Being beliefs. However, Charlie scores high on Extraterrestrial Cover-Up.\n\n![Charlie's final results on the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale provided at the end of the questionnaire.](images/charlie_kelly_results.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nCharlie having a high conpriacy score should come at no surprise to anyone who's watched the show...\n\n![Charlie's conspiratorial rant about the mail from Episode 10 Season 4.](images/pepe-silvia.webp){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Mac\n\nMac/Ronald positively responded (Somewhat Agreed or Agreed) to 20% of the statements. They negatively responded (Somewhat Disagreed or Disagreed) to 33.3% of statements.\n\nMac seems to score the highest on Control of Information. They score low on Personal Well-Being and Malevolent Global Conspiracies.\n\n![Mac's final results on the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale provided at the end of the questionnaire.](images/ronald_mcdonald_results.png)\n\n### Dennis\n\nDennis positively responded (Somewhat Agreed or Agreed) to 60% of the statements. They negatively responded (Somewhat Disagreed or Disagreed) to 40% of statements.\n\nDennis scores very highly on Control of Information and Malevolent Global Conspiracies. Similar to others, they score low on Personal Well-Being beliefs.\n\n![Dennis's final results on the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale provided at the end of the questionnaire.](images/dennis_reynolds_results.png)\n\n### Dee: The Skeptical Bird\n\nDee positively responded (Somewhat Agreed or Agreed) to 20% of the statements. They negatively responded (Somewhat Disagreed or Disagreed) to 40% of statements.\n\nDee's overall score is slightly above the normative group score, but is the lowest relative to other members of the gang.\n\n![Dee's final results on the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale provided at the end of the questionnaire.](images/dee_reynolds_results.png)\n\n### Summary\n\nInterestingly, even though they are all part of the same chaotic group, The Gang's scores show quite a bit of variation in their specific conspiracy beliefs. For example, Dee remains somewhat skeptical, while Dennis and Frank show stronger overall belief in conspiracies. What's not surprising, however, is that each member scores above average in their conspiracy scores.\n\n## The Power of Persona Manipulation\n\nAgain, with little effort, we can construct personas based on limited information and manipulate questionnaire responses. In a recruitment setting, a candidate only needs a company's values, culture, and job specifications. Generative AI could easily align responses to make them more desirable, raising ethical concerns. This gives an unfair advantage to deceptive candidates, potentially harming genuine applicants.\n\nConsider how easy the setup here was undertaken. It can be made even easier through front-end applications where users only have to copy and paste text/take photos in order to prompt Generative AI. If this is already being carried out, unbeknownst to recruiters, it does raise concerns on the validity of personality questionnaires in a recruitment context. If measures are not a valid representation of the candidate, will the scores predict performance? Doubtful. Therefore, any company using personality measures at part of their recruitment should evaluate the vulnerability of this method to Generative AI. Without doing so, they may already be at-risk of candidates being deceitful within the sifting process.\n\nAs a whole, it does raise further questions on how you develop new sifting methods to deal with the vulnerability that Generative AI creates? Also, could Generative AI be used to create the 'perfect' candidate?\n",
